I have managed to reverse engineer bunch of android application using `Burpsuite`+`Frida` and this is the collection of all available API till now. These features can break anytime soon since the decryption keys of server response are change frequently by server. I am still not able to decrypt `DES` encryption for ``ChatGPT A2``, so this returns the encrypted server response. I will fix this once I learn `crypto` library. Also I will be adding more APIs. Thanks.
